# Harry Potter Hangman
This application allows users to play a game of hangman with a Harry Potter twist. 

## How to Play
Click <a href='https://youtu.be/ndmb_4aoyJs'>here</a> to watch a video demo of the game.

To begin playing this game, click <a href = 'https://lkanand.github.io/Hangman-Game/'>here</a> and press any key on your keyboard. Upon doing so, a string of underlines representing a proper noun from the Harry Potter book series will dissolve onto the screen. In order to win a game, you must input all of the characters in the selected word before running out of your allotted eight incorrect guesses (the game does not count repeated guesses against you). Once you either correctly guess the word or run out of your allotted incorrect guesses, the program will initialize a new game.
